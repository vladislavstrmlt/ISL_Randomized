## My IMO training
In 2024, I qualified for the International Math Olympiad.
Being interested in 'automating' and stuff (even though
it's probably useless for real practical purposes), I
decided to make this 'problem giver' from a problem
database that will generate PDF's with desired topics.
The database consists mostly of the IMO Shortlists from
previous years.

It works as a streamlit app hosted on Streamlit's cloud.
So check out the app [TODO_ADD_LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
